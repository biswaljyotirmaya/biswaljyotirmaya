🌟 About Me
I'm a Java Full Stack Developer based in Hyderabad, India, with a passion for building scalable, high-performance web applications. With hands-on experience in Java, Spring Boot, and React, I’ve delivered 4+ end-to-end projects, including a microservices-driven e-commerce platform. Currently mentoring at Naresh iTechnologies, I guide students in mastering full-stack development while exploring cutting-edge tools like Docker and Kafka. My goal? To create impactful solutions that blend robust backends with seamless user experiences.

🔍 Currently working on: A multi-vendor e-commerce platform with Spring Boot microservices.
🚀 Learning: Kafka for event-driven systems, Kubernetes for orchestration, and CI/CD pipelines.
💡 Fun fact: I’m a competitive programming enthusiast who loves solving complex problems!
